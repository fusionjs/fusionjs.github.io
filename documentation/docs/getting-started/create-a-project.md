# Create a project

## Using yarn create

To create a new Fusion.js application we recommend using [yarn create](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/). In a terminal, run the following:

```
yarn create fusion-app my-fusion-app
```

The last argument provided will be used as the application name and for generating a project within your current working directory.

In the future we will be adding additional questions during the creation process to enable additional features. Those questions will be documented here.

## Example Fusion.js projects

Here is a curated list of example Fusion.js open source applications. You might use these as a starting point to see what Fusion.js application development looks like. [File an issue](https://www.github.com/fusionjs/fusionjs.github.io/issues/new) to have your Fusion.js application added.
