# Fetching data

Out of the box, we support data fetching in web applications with the following components:

1.  [fusion-plugin-rpc-redux-react](/api/fusion-plugin-rpc-redux-react) is used to abstract away universal communication between components, redux store, and the server.
2.  [fusion-react](/api/fusion-react) is used to trigger RPC calls during the render lifecycle.
3.  [fusion-apollo](/api/fusion-apollo) can be used for leveraging GraphQL and Fusion.js.
