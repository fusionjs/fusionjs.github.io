# Getting started

Fusion.js is an open source web application framework for building high quality universal React/Redux/Node applications. If you've never used React/Redux before, [start here](/docs/getting-started/required-knowledge).

Fusion.js is a collection of packages which form the core runtime, CLI, and build system. In addition, there are a set of [plugins](/api/plugins) that integrate with Fusion.js's Plugin API. Most of Fusion.js's functionality is added through these plugins.

The Fusion.js scaffold generated when you [create a new project](/docs/getting-started/create-a-project) comes with a set of pre-configured plugins, allowing you the freedom to just start writing your product features.

Check out the [Fusion API documentation](/api/fusion-docs) for a deeper look into Fusion's functionality.

### Example app

We have a list of Fusion.js boilerplate applications at: https://github.com/kevingrandon/fusion-boilerplate. We're looking to expand upon these boilerplate applications.
