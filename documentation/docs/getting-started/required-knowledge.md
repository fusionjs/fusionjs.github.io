# Required knowledge

Many Fusion.js applications will use React and Redux as well as abstractions built on top of these technologies. If you are not well-versed in React and/or Redux, below we have compiled a few tutorials and documentation pages that will help give you a good base for building a web application at Uber.

### React

Read Facebook's [Thinking In React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html) page and their [React Tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html).

### Redux

Watch [Getting Started with Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux) by Dan Abramov (creator of Redux).

If you prefer reading, the [Redux documentation](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/) is very thorough and covers similar content.

### React + Redux

Watch [Building React Applications with Idiomatic Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux). This is the follow-up course to Dan Abramov's Redux course.
