# Server code

If you need to implement server-side code to fetch data from a service, [consider using RPC, as described in the fetching data section](/docs/guides/fetching-data)

### Advanced usage

If you need to modify the HTML template (e.g. the `<head>` or `<title>` tags), see [this section](/docs/guides/creating-a-plugin/modifying-html-template)

If you need to augment a Fusion.js application via a custom plugin, see [this section](/docs/guides/creating-a-plugin)
